The school is very well-run, with every detail considered in light of successful future school and student development. Lesson plans are well thought out. The curriculum choices are excellent. Extra curricular activities and school sponsored opportunities are in line with those at much larger schools (spelling bee, math competitions, writing programs, etc). Discipline is handled with careful character development from a biblical perspective. I'm very glad we chose a university model school for our family. It's challenging to homeschool multiple students, but it's worth all the effort when I look at how my kids are developing, both academically and spiritually. Our family is closer, and my kids are happier. Paratus is a very challenging school academically, but there is plenty of room to assist the struggling student or challenge the gifted student. I find the teachers to be very accessible, and Paratus has an amazing parent community to \"do life\" with. We're so thankful that this school exists to partner with our family in raising up godly, well-educated children.",

The faculty and administration know each student, and work hard to make a challenging curriculum engaging. The student body is diverse, both racially and economically and yet the school still has a culture of unity and acceptance. A note on testing: The students ace the state test each year, but there are no ridiculous drills wasting class time -- they just take the test for a few hours and move on. I love this school and am so sad that our time there is done.",

However, they are not good in working with individual student differences. They attribute individual student academic issues to individual student deficits versus legitimate learning problems such as add/adhd or dyslexia. There is a marked lack of diferentiation. Very frustrating!",

The teachers actually CARE about their students. I've seen teachers go \"far and above\" to make sure each student understands the concepts. Those teachers have taken my kids and given them the knowledge and confidence to succeed in middle school. Can a parent ask for anything more? I've spoken with parents who have had kids go through CSA in the past and the parents STILL credit that school with their children's successes! What does that say about the teachers?? They are wonderful. EVERY one of them is wonderful. My family is truly blessed to be a part of Cornerstone. I can't express that enough.",

The co-teaching that happens at this school is a great benefit to students. I believe this school does alot to give students many avenues to learn what is expected of them with lots of ways to learn and always a positive attitude towards the child. The school is a great bridge between elementary school and high school. Each student is treated like the important individual that they are and given a great opportunity to thrive. I could not be happier with Cornerstone Academy!",

              "review": "We have just completed the worst year at Cornerstone. The 7th grade Math/Science teachers were horrible! Our teachers completely disregarded SBISD grading policy by failing to have the minimum amount of grades required by the District. Our teachers also had other SBISD policy infractions that were brought before the Director. The teachers were pretty new to teaching, did not enjoy it, could not differentiate their teaching methods to accommodate kids learning styles, and bullied the kids. About 1/4 of the class failed the year and attended summer school. The Director knew of the problems in the class and failed to react to the situation. She was unwilling to accept that there was a problem in the class and more unwilling to do her job to remedy the situation. The Director has checked out on the education process and is resting on her past successes. What should have been a great year was a very disappointing year. Cornerstone has developed a reputation in the greater SBISD community as having a flawed grading system, assigning group projects that don't work, having teachers who play favorites, and most importantly, matriculating kids who are not ready to transition to High School.",

Difference one of the time my child was in the hospital and i was left with the bill because the shoolbus lawyers says they cannot cover injuries that occur while your child is in their drivers care.

In fact, we chose to build a house in this school zone because we were so impressed by the principal and the school's overall reputation. The teachers are all so kind and we are amazed by how much our kids are learning. We also really appreciate that our kids truly love going to school each weekday. Since we are new to the area we have been pleasantly surprised by how warm and friendly the other parents are. The school is currently being rebuilt and will be ready in January of 2015.

Don't be fooled by the test scores, look at the scores broken down by ethnicity and you will see it competes with the schools south of I-10. There is a bit more diversity, which we love, our children's eyes are opened not everyone lives in a house and has two cars. The ESL parents are very kind and clearly care about their children's education. The PTO does an amazing job bridging the gap between the ESL and non-ESL classes. The staff is reported to be the best in the district, and teachers tend to stay because of the principal and parental support. I saw the post from the former private school folks, the school is filled with families that once went private and they all seem happy. The principal gives tours, come check this school out!",

An advantage I think Memorial has is networking, at least for STEM majors, many students go on to attend amazing STEM programs(MIT, Georgia Tech, Purdue, Caltech, Stanford, UT Austin, Michigan, Illinois, Berkeley, you name it), and Memorial is relatively close-knit, so you are likely to find valuable networks as early as a high school student.",

I know sarcasm is hard to distinguish on the internet, but I'm not being facetious. I'm glad you felt comfortable, but think for a moment as to why it was so nice. If you thrived because others were treated poorly, then I would re-evaluate the whole experience. To the kids headed to Memorial, the kids who are currently enrolled in Memorial, and to my peers who are reminiscing like I am, let me say this: the entirety of Memorial's potential is being wasted. As the highest funded school in SBISD, with one of the highest-paid principals in Houston, and a population of students that come from affluent families, I find it embarrassing that the only thing the general public seems to remember about Memorial is its reputation for being insensitive and full of ignorance. I don't anticipate that my review on this random website will be world-changing, but I do hope that other people see this and recognize that they aren't alone in their criticism of this school. In that case, I hope it was worth the hour and a half that I put into these responses.",

As white being the mass percentage of all the ethnicities this prompts lots of isssues: though this not being a problem resulting from the school it self but the zoneing of the SBISD district. Racial issues often occur and could be regulated insted of silenced. I do believe that any student who attends or will attend memorial high school will gain a greater appriciation for various perspectives of one's around them, this is though, through experiences up front disclosure from their peers. To gain greater appriciation one will have to dissipate stereotypes that many students at memorial create against eachother. All high schools will have their problems and, bullies, but it's about the result and action that is taken place after a certain event causing emotional harm. The lack of support for these students being bullied is weak. Finding a way to create a heathy enviorment with differnt ethnicities, but white being the mass persentage come with challenges, but it's how memorial high school presives themselves as if they want to portray and encourage the mass persentage of whites to stand as the essence for what they want to persue. Even being white myself I stongly believe that one school and how it runs should not be based on one ethnicity; and definitely one perspective.",

Difference one of the time my child was in the hospital and i was left with the bill because the shoolbus lawyers says they cannot cover injuries that occur while your child is in their drivers care. Did i mention an open wound with hematoma after. And im stuck with the bill. Would i recommend? NO. Not for children with special needs.",

In fact, we chose to build a house in this school zone because we were so impressed by the principal and the school's overall reputation. The teachers are all so kind and we are amazed by how much our kids are learning. We also really appreciate that our kids truly love going to school each weekday. Since we are new to the area we have been pleasantly surprised by how warm and friendly the other parents are. The school is currently being rebuilt and will be ready in January of 2015. I would highly recommend VOE!",

Don't be fooled by the test scores, look at the scores broken down by ethnicity and you will see it competes with the schools south of I-10. There is a bit more diversity, which we love, our children's eyes are opened not everyone lives in a house and has two cars. The ESL parents are very kind and clearly care about their children's education. The PTO does an amazing job bridging the gap between the ESL and non-ESL classes. The staff is reported to be the best in the district, and teachers tend to stay because of the principal and parental support. I saw the post from the former private school folks, the school is filled with families that once went private and they all seem happy. The principal gives tours, come check this school out!",

Also, a poor selection of inappropriate pop music was selected for the soon-to-be 6th graders during their school tour (I.e. Rock - Star / Clean version). Not the kind of music you would think would be in a school auditorium. Maybe I\u2019m getting old, but shouldn\u2019t that be for after school - if they listen to it?

It was also a pretty drama-free experience for me. An advantage I think Memorial has is networking, at least for STEM majors, many students go on to attend amazing STEM programs(MIT, Georgia Tech, Purdue, Caltech, Stanford, UT Austin, Michigan, Illinois, Berkeley, you name it), and Memorial is relatively close-knit, so you are likely to find valuable networks as early as a high school student.",

I know sarcasm is hard to distinguish on the internet, but I'm not being facetious. I'm glad you felt comfortable, but think for a moment as to why it was so nice. If you thrived because others were treated poorly, then I would re-evaluate the whole experience. To the kids headed to Memorial, the kids who are currently enrolled in Memorial, and to my peers who are reminiscing like I am, let me say this: the entirety of Memorial's potential is being wasted. As the highest funded school in SBISD, with one of the highest-paid principals in Houston, and a population of students that come from affluent families, I find it embarrassing that the only thing the general public seems to remember about Memorial is its reputation for being insensitive and full of ignorance. I don't anticipate that my review on this random website will be world-changing, but I do hope that other people see this and recognize that they aren't alone in their criticism of this school. In that case, I hope it was worth the hour and a half that I put into these responses.",

My sophomore does not know what the p-pal looks like.College counseling is non-existent; they just give you a bunch of web sites to visit. Yeah, don't need them to tell me that. The PTA spends a bunch of money on crisis counselors to help all the over-achieving sleep-deprived kids who are taking speed to wake up and downers to fall asleep at night, I think.At least it is peaceful; not a bunch of gang-type violence, not a lot of overt drug-dealing/using.

As white being the mass percentage of all the ethnicities this prompts lots of isssues: though this not being a problem resulting from the school it self but the zoneing of the SBISD district. Racial issues often occur and could be regulated insted of silenced. I do believe that any student who attends or will attend memorial high school will gain a greater appriciation for various perspectives of one's around them, this is though, through experiences up front disclosure from their peers. To gain greater appriciation one will have to dissipate stereotypes that many students at memorial create against eachother. All high schools will have their problems and, bullies, but it's about the result and action that is taken place after a certain event causing emotional harm. The lack of support for these students being bullied is weak. Finding a way to create a heathy enviorment with differnt ethnicities, but white being the mass persentage come with challenges, but it's how memorial high school presives themselves as if they want to portray and encourage the mass persentage of whites to stand as the essence for what they want to persue. Even being white myself I stongly believe that one school and how it runs should not be based on one ethnicity; and definitely one perspective.",
